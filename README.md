Post-Quantum-Cryptography

Welcome to the Post-Quantum-Cryptography repository! This project showcases a comprehensive approach towards post-quantum resistant cryptography, aimed at addressing the potential threats posed by quantum computing to current cryptographic methods.

Overview

As quantum computing continues to advance, traditional cryptographic algorithms may become vulnerable to attacks. This repository provides an example of how to implement post-quantum resistant cryptography techniques to mitigate these threats. It includes implementations of various cryptographic systems, data integrity and authentication mechanisms, and encryption algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers.

Features

- Implementation of post-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms.
- Demonstrations of data integrity and authentication mechanisms.
